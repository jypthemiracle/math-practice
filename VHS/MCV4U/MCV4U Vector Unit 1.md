# MCV4U Vector Unit 1

## Scalar Quantity

* A quantity such as speed, which only has magnitude while no direction is called a scalar.
  * scalars are specified completely by giving a real number.
  * example: ```s=500km/h```, ```d=500m```, ```delta t=4h```

## Vector Quantity

* A quantity such as velocity, which has both magnitude and direction is called a scalar.

  * Each vector is represented by an arrow.

  * The length of the arrow is drawn proportional to the magnitude of the vector.

  * The arrow is always drawn so that it points in the direction of the vector it represents.

  * The direction of vector can be described using north, south, east or west.

  * example: 
    $$
    \vec(v)=500km/h \ East \\ or \\ \vec(v) = 500km \ [E]
    $$

  * Question:

    * The weight of the rabbit is ```19.6N```. The weight of any object can be calculated using the following formula.

    $$
    \vec(W) = m\vec(g) \\ where \ m \ = \ mass, \ \vec(g) = \ 9.8m/s^2
    $$

    ​	Note that the acceleration due to gravity on the moon is ```1.7 m/s2``` (which is approximately ```1/6t⁢h``` the acceleration due 	to gravity on the earth.) If you take the same rabbit to the moon, what will be its weight? Is it lighter or heavier than on 	Earth?

    * Answer: The rabbit would be lighter on the moon that on the earth with respect to weight, but the mass would be identical in both planets.

## Bearing

* The term "bearing" is often used in navigation to describe the direction of an object from the observer.

### True Bearing

* The term "true bearing" is the direction that an object is relative to true north.
* The lighthouse is on a true bearing of 40 degree relative to true north.
* The **true bearing** to a point is the [angle](https://www.mathsteacher.com.au/year7/ch08_angles/01_ang/ang.htm#angle) measured in [degrees](https://www.mathsteacher.com.au/year7/ch08_angles/01_ang/ang.htm#size) in a clockwise direction from the north line. We will refer to the true bearing simply as the **bearing**.

![The bearing or true bearing of P and Q is shown](https://www.mathsteacher.com.au/year7/ch08_angles/07_bear/Image10589.gif)

* For example, the bearing of point *P* is 065º which is the number of degrees in the angle measured in a clockwise direction from the north line to the line joining the centre of the compass at *O* with the point *P* (i.e. *OP*).
* The bearing of point *Q* is 300º which is the number of degrees in the angle measured in a clockwise direction from the north line to the line joining the centre of the compass at *O* with the point *Q* (i.e. *OQ*).

![The relative bearings of A and B are shown](https://www.mathsteacher.com.au/year7/ch08_angles/07_bear/Image10590.gif)

* The bearing of a point is the number of degrees in the angle measured in a clockwise direction from the north line to the line joining the centre of the compass with the point.
* A bearing is used to represent the direction of one point relative to another point.
* For example, the bearing of *A* from *B* is 065º. The bearing of *B* from *A* is 245º.

### Magnetic Bearing

* Traditionally, magnetic compasses are used to find where north is approximately.
* The difference between true north and magnetic north is called ``declination``, and declination varies depending on where you are in the world; and it also tends to change slightly every year.

## Vector Notation

### Methods

* A vector has both:

  * magnitude.

  * direction.

  * We could call the following as describing a magnitude of 3.6 on a bearing of 034 degree.

  * We could also think of the vector as lying on a grid. The vector would be described as [2, 3] with the Cartesian System.

    * The vector [2, 3] is the vector that would have its head at the point (2, 3) if its tail were at the point (0, 0).

The tail and the head both lie on a point on the grid. ](https://lms.virtualhighschool.com/content/vhs3/departments/mat/courses/mcv4u/mcv4u_e/content/vectors_1262/vector_notation_6688/images/111802-md.png?_&d2lSessionVal=AQKKC4Jb4pl6zMpjyZztQDFSt&ou=63216)

### Converting: Direction/Magnitude to Cartesian Form

* If we want to add two vectors, we need to have them in Cartesian Form by converting from the direction/magnitude form.

* A plane travels 250km on a bearing of 72 degree. Express this vector using Cartesian form.
